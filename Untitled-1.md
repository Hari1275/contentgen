üéØ IMMEDIATE FOCUS: Choose ONE Primary Stack
Based on current market demand and your existing skills, here's my recommendation:

Primary Stack: React + Node.js/TypeScript
Why this combination:

Highest market demand (60%+ of job postings)
You already know React/Next.js - build on existing knowledge
JavaScript/TypeScript across full stack = faster learning
AI-resistant (requires complex problem-solving and architecture decisions)
Excellent salary potential ($80k-$150k+)
Secondary Stack: Python (FastAPI/Django)
Why as secondary:

Growing demand in AI/ML companies
Great for backend APIs and data processing
Complements your React frontend perfectly
Future-proof with AI integration opportunities
üìã 90-Day Action Plan
Phase 1: Foundation Strengthening (Days 1-30)
Week 1-2: JavaScript/TypeScript Mastery

Complete "JavaScript: The Hard Parts" course
Master: Closures, Promises, async/await, ES6+ features
Practice: 2 coding problems daily on LeetCode (Easy level)
Week 3-4: React Deep Dive

Advanced React patterns (Custom hooks, Context, Performance optimization)
State management with Zustand/Redux Toolkit
Build one complex React project with authentication
Phase 2: Backend Mastery (Days 31-60)
Week 5-6: Node.js + Express/Fastify

Build a full-stack project (e-commerce or social media clone)
Phase 3: Interview Preparation (Days 61-90)
Week 9-10: Algorithm Practice

LeetCode: 3 problems daily (Easy to Medium)
Focus on: Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, Trees
Practice explaining solutions out loud
Week 11-12: System Design + Portfolio
