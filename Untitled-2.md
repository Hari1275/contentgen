Networking: Join 2-3 developer Discord/Slack communities
ðŸš€ Key Success Factors:
Don't Try to Be Perfect
Start with 70% consistency rather than waiting for perfect conditions
Your 4 years of experience is valuable - build on it, don't start over
Apply to jobs while learning (don't wait until you feel "ready")
Focus on Depth Over Breadth
Master React + Node.js deeply rather than jumping between technologies
Build impressive projects that showcase your skills
Quality over quantity in your portfolio
Embrace the Process
Track your progress daily (it's motivating to see improvement)
Celebrate small wins (solved a hard problem, explained a concept clearly)
Connect with other developers (you're not alone in this journey)
ðŸ’ª Addressing Your Specific Concerns:
About AI Taking Jobs:
AI makes developers more productive, not obsolete
Focus on problem-solving, architecture, and communication (AI can't replace these)
Learn to use AI tools as productivity enhancers
Your experience in understanding business requirements is valuable
About Being "Stuck" at One Company:
4 years of experience is actually valuable stability
You've likely solved complex problems - document these as STAR stories
Your LoopBack experience shows you can learn complex frameworks
Companies value developers who can stick with projects long-term
About Interview Anxiety:
Practice makes confidence - do 2 mock interviews per week
Remember: interviews are conversations, not interrogations
Your experience gives you real stories to tell
Focus on what you've learned and built, not what you don't know
