VISUAL SUGGESTIONS:

**Images/Graphics:**

1.  **Image:** A person enjoying an outdoor activity (e.g., hiking, gardening, playing with kids) in a bright, natural setting, free from allergy symptoms. The person should look genuinely happy and carefree.
    *   **Description:** This image reinforces the idea of reclaiming joy and living life to the fullest without the constraints of allergies. It visually communicates the desired outcome of using Nishamritha Tablets. Designer should ensure that the setting is relatable (not overly aspirational) and evokes a sense of peace and well-being.
2.  **Graphic:** An illustration depicting the concept of *dosha* balance in Ayurveda.
    *   **Description:** This graphic should visually represent the *Kapha* and *Pitta* *doshas* and how Nishamritha Tablets help to bring them back into equilibrium. It could be a simple, elegant design showing scales being balanced or a harmonious flow of energy within the body. Use brand colors and a style that aligns with SDP Ayurveda's aesthetic.
3.  **Image:** Close-up shot of Nishamritha Tablets alongside key Ayurvedic herbs used in the formulation.
    *   **Description:** Showcase the natural ingredients of the tablets. The image should have a clean, natural aesthetic, highlighting the purity and quality of the herbs. Consider using soft lighting and natural textures to create an appealing and trustworthy image.

**Suggested Color Scheme:**

*   Primary colors: SDP Ayurveda's brand colors (refer to brand guidelines). Typically, Ayurvedic brands use earthy tones like greens, browns, and warm oranges.
*   Secondary colors: Light blues and creams to evoke a sense of calm and purity.
*   Accent color: A brighter, natural green to highlight the herbal ingredients and natural benefits.

**Layout Recommendations:**

*   **Hero Section:** Use the outdoor activity image (Image 1) as a large, visually appealing header. Overlay text with the title and a brief, compelling description of Nishamritha Tablets.
*   **Section: Understanding Allergies Through Ayurveda:** Use the *dosha* balance graphic (Graphic 2) alongside explanatory text. Consider a two-column layout, with the graphic on one side and the text on the other.
*   **Section: The Power of Nishamritha Tablets:** Use the close-up shot of the tablets and herbs (Image 3) to highlight the natural ingredients. Use bullet points to list key benefits.
*   **Benefits and Uses Section:** Use icons to represent each listed symptom (sneezing, itchy eyes, congestion, etc.). This will make the information more visually engaging and easier to digest.
*   **Incorporating Nishamritha Section:** Consider adding a small graphic depicting a person meditating or practicing mindful breathing. This will visually represent the holistic approach to allergy management.
*   **Call to Action:** Use a visually distinct button with a clear call to action (e.g., "Shop Now & Save 15%"). Place this button strategically throughout the blog, especially after key benefit statements.
